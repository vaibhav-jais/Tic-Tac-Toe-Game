# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

Tic Tac Toe is one of the most played games and is the best game that you can play anywhere with just a pen and paper. The game is played by two individuals. First, we draw a board with a 3×3 square grid. The first player chooses ‘X’ and draws it on any of the square grid, then it’s the chance of the second player to draw ‘O’ on the available spaces. Like this, the players draw ‘X’ and ‘O’ alternatively on the empty spaces until a player succeeds in drawing 3 consecutive marks either in the horizontal, vertical or diagonal way. Then the player wins the game otherwise the game draws when all spots are filled.

This project was build using the pygame library which allows us to create windows and draw images and shapes on the window.
